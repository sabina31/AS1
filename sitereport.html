          <p>Even though I have not previously interacted with HTML or CSS languages, I found the learning very enjoyable. Its’ terminology is easily understandable and I managed to remember it fairly quickly. </p>
          <p>I believe my biggest struggle was working with GitHub, as I started having problems with it from very beginning (took me a while to just install Git on my MacBook, it wasn’t running properly for some reason).</p>
<p>When the time came to start working on this assignment, I had quite a good idea of HTML and CSS basics and was positive about my new skills.</p>
<p>Not everything went as planned for me. When my MacBook started extremely overheating and making a lot of noise right before the spring break, so I had to take it to repair for nearly 2 weeks. As all my files and software were on that computer, I wasn’t able to start properly working on the assignment until quite late.</p>
<p>My choice of colours for the layout was quite obvious as pink is my favourite color. I found a really lovely animated background in CSS (referred below) and decided it would be a great addition to my design. My main font, Grape Nuts, was found on Google Fonts, and animations were taken from CSS animations library (referred below). All links can be found directly on my website on Home Page too.</p>
<p>It took me an enormous effort to make sure the grid layout was looking good on any screen size, as well as adapting everything to a mobile display.</p>
<p>Most of my codes were taken from my previous files from the tasks that we worked on in the class, and presentations we were showed by Chris.</p>
